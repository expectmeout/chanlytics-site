Chanlytics is an AI‑powered business automation platform that unifies five core capabilities—an omni‑channel AI Agent System for capturing and qualifying leads across calls, SMS, email, and social DMs; backend AI automations that handle reminders, quotes, invoices, and review/referral requests; a smart portal for real‑time visibility into conversations, outcomes, and performance; a personal AI assistant that answers operational questions from your business data; and deep integrations that connect your existing stack (e.g., HubSpot, Salesforce, Slack) into one cohesive, automated workflow. By replacing manual handoffs and follow‑ups with always‑on, rules‑driven AI processes, Chanlytics shortens response times, increases show‑up rates, and closes the loop on every task that typically slips through the cracks. Teams see meaningful productivity gains—fewer hours spent on admin, faster lead‑to‑appointment cycles, higher conversion from consistent follow‑through, and better forecasting from unified analytics—resulting in lower operating costs and more revenue without hiring more staff.
